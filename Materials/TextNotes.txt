Spath Pro Android With Kotlin Good writing and better overview than Forrester I think.  
    Spath does a lot of books, including another focused on Kotlin for Android, which is mostly just Kotlin.
    This one is clear, but high-level concepts about Activities, Services, Intents, etc.  Not a beginner's code walkthrough
    Probably worth looking at before the ch 4-> of Laurance

Laurance Excellent conceptual presentation esp for experienced coders
   Chap 1 and 2 on Kotlin are fine.
   Chaps 3 is OK for overview of design, but quite abstract
   Chaps 4 -> are solely advanced topics not useful till basic apps are being built

Maybe
Forrester  Direct, hands-on, how-to
Moskala  Kotlin-centric, reasonably well-written
Skeen Kotlin BNR book -- Good Kotlin intro with some Android.  BNR stuff looks good overall, but their Android books are all Java

No
SommerHoff Panned for being out of date -- don't use
   

Online Docs at developer.android.com
   App Basics are worth reading through

   Courses look like a good tutorial, though video not text


   Codelabs look like recorded conference tutorials on specialized topics
   Guide to App Architecture is another abstract but usable high-level guide.
   Architecture components are in the same vein as Laurance ch 4-> : geek-level advanced discussions of design and power libraries.
   Examples may provide some code elements to decipher, but none are general purpose apps a la messaging app
