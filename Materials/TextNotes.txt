Texts

Yes
Spath Pro Android With Kotlin Good writing and better overview than Forrester I think.  
    Spath does a lot of books, including another focused on Kotlin for Android, which is mostly just Kotlin.
Laurance Excellent conceptual presentation esp for experienced coders

Maybe
Forrester  Direct, hands-on, how-to
Moskala  Kotlin-centric, reasonably well-written
Skeen Kotlin BNR book -- Good Kotlin intro with some Android.  BNR stuff looks good overall, but their Android books are all Java

No
SommerHoff Panned for being out of date -- don't use
