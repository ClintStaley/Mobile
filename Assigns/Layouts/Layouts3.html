<h3 class="western">Overview</h3>
<p>This and later exercises will draw on the introductory courses
supplied at 
</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses</p>
<p>and for the first homeworks, this course in particular:</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course</p>
<p>Each of these courses is somewhat &quot;code by the numbers&quot;
overview of Android dev topics. To use them effectively, note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The videos are mostly just cute rah-rah, so you can skip
	those.</p>
	<li><p>The codelab walkthroughs are where the serious content is.
	For these, actually write the code, don't just copy-paste it. And:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>First, read through a portion of the presentation, up to an
		entire path depending on how good your memory is.</p>
		<li><p>Then, *set aside the example code and presentation*, and
		write the code yourself, from memory as much as possible, checking
		the presentation only as absolutely necessary.</p>
		<li><p>As you write each line, be sure you understand what it does
		and why.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>A canned example like these codelabs is just a starting
	point. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Do deeper exploration of the classes used, via the API
		reference and other sources. Find out how they're organized, what
		their inheritance relationships are, etc. Bookmark useful points of
		the API reference.</p>
		<li><p>Based on what you learned, explore &quot;around&quot; the
		code, trying different alternatives to see how they work. 
		</p>
		<li><p>I'll help with this by assigning required homework
		explorations surrounding the code in the walkthroughs, but learn
		also to do this for yourself.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">Unit 3: Layouts: <font face="Albany, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><b>Display
a Scrollable List</b></font></font></h3>
<p>Much of this path centers on the sophisticated OO design
surrounding RecyclerViews</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Review the developer.android.com | Guides | App Resources |
	Introduction and Localization.</p>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li><p>Name at least 10 distinct properties of R, e.g. R.id,
	R.color, etc.  How are such properties consistently referred to
	within layout and other resource files?</p>
	<li><p>What tool/program generates the R class?  What file does it
	produce?  What kind of information does it add to that file? 
	</p>
	<li><p>What's an APK?  Are resources like layouts, colors, etc. held
	in readable form in an APK?</p>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
	<li><p>Adjust names and some functionality as you write the code, so
	as not to just cut/paste what's there.  In particular</p>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li><p>Choose less trite quotes.  I used Bible and S&amp;H.  And
	change the name to Quotes not Affirmations.  Drop the generic and
	unclear word &quot;Item&quot; in favor of &quot;Quote&quot; in class
	and property names.</p>
	<li><p>Build the layout as described, including cards, etc. 
	Snapshot this as part of your submission for this question.   Then,
	adjust the layout of each image and its quote according to the
	attached snapshot</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Place each quote inside the image, offset from the left edge
		and bottom</p>
		<li><p>Put a background and border in gold and blue around each
		quote.  Do this by creating a Shape Drawable describing the
		background and border and using it as the background for the
		TextView showing the quote.</p>
		<li><p>Arrange the QuoteAdapter so that the font of the text
		alternates between normal and bold.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
	<li><p>Experiment by reversing the two args to Quote when supplying
	an image and a string.   The IDE should note the error even though
	both args are strings.  How does it do this?</p>
	<li><p>Use logging to instrument onCreateViewHolder and
	onBindViewHolder, so you can see how often they are called.  Is
	there a difference in how many times each is called?   Try doubling
	the number of quotes and images, by simply duplicating the ones you
	already have to make the data array twice as long.  What happens to
	the number of calls of onCreateViewHolder and onBindViewHolder then?
	 Why is this?</p>
	<li><p></p>
</ol>
