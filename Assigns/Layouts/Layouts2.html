<h3 class="western">Overview</h3>
<p>This and later exercises will draw on the introductory courses
supplied at 
</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses</p>
<p>and for the first homeworks, this course in particular:</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course</p>
<p>Each of these courses is somewhat &quot;code by the numbers&quot;
overview of Android dev topics. To use them effectively, note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The videos are mostly just cute rah-rah, so you can skip
	those.</p>
	<li><p>The codelab walkthroughs are where the serious content is.
	For these, actually write the code, don't just copy-paste it.  And:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>First, read through a portion of the presentation, up to an
		entire path depending on how good your memory is.</p>
		<li><p>Then, *set aside the example code and presentation*, and
		write the code yourself, from memory as much as possible, checking
		the presentation only as absolutely necessary.</p>
		<li><p>As you write each line, be sure you understand what it does
		and why.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>A canned example like these codelabs is just a starting
	point.  
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Do deeper exploration of the classes used, via the API
		reference and other sources.  Find out how they're organized, what
		their inheritance relationships are, etc.  Bookmark useful points
		of the API reference.</p>
		<li><p>Based on what you learned, explore &quot;around&quot; the
		code, trying different alternatives to see how they work. 
		</p>
		<li><p>I'll help with this by assigning required homework
		explorations surrounding the code in the walkthroughs, but learn
		also to do this for yourself.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Do the quiz at the end of each path, and please report as
	part of your homework submission how well you did on it.</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">Unit 2: Layouts: <b>Create XML Layouts for

<p>Submit three files:</p>
<p>1. Questions.pdf/docx/html with answers to the noncoding
questions.</p>
<p>2. MainActivity.kt and activity_main.xml, for your answers for 6
and 3, after demoing to me</p>
