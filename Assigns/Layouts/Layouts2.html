<h3 class="western">Overview</h3>
<p>This and later exercises will draw on the introductory courses
supplied at 
</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses</p>
<p>and for the first homeworks, this course in particular:</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course</p>
<p>Each of these courses is somewhat &quot;code by the numbers&quot;
overview of Android dev topics. To use them effectively, note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The videos are mostly just cute rah-rah, so you can skip
	those.</p>
	<li><p>The codelab walkthroughs are where the serious content is.
	For these, actually write the code, don't just copy-paste it. And:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>First, read through a portion of the presentation, up to an
		entire path depending on how good your memory is.</p>
		<li><p>Then, *set aside the example code and presentation*, and
		write the code yourself, from memory as much as possible, checking
		the presentation only as absolutely necessary.</p>
		<li><p>As you write each line, be sure you understand what it does
		and why.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>A canned example like these codelabs is just a starting
	point. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Do deeper exploration of the classes used, via the API
		reference and other sources. Find out how they're organized, what
		their inheritance relationships are, etc. Bookmark useful points of
		the API reference.</p>
		<li><p>Based on what you learned, explore &quot;around&quot; the
		code, trying different alternatives to see how they work. 
		</p>
		<li><p>I'll help with this by assigning required homework
		explorations surrounding the code in the walkthroughs, but learn
		also to do this for yourself.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">Unit 2: Layouts: <b>Create XML Layouts for
Android Pt 2</b></h3>
<p>Much of this path centers on what is sometimes called &quot;paint&quot;
-- the artistic and aesthetic tuning of a UI's colors, fonts, icons,
etc. It's easy to dismiss this as window dressing, but it's not.
People like to use good-looking UIs, and industrial design and
aesthetics are an interesting area, with significant technical
elements.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>For the first step, use the concepts of theme and style to
	set up a version of TipTime that has Principia blue and gold
	coloring for its primary and secondary colors. And, arrange the code
	so that you can, by changing just one word in the source, switch the
	app (after rebuilding and restarting) between Prin colors and the
	original purple-ish scheme. Unsurprisingly, this will involve some
	independent research on how the magic of themes works, and in
	particular how your layout &quot;knows&quot; what theme to apply.</p>
	<li><p>Build for a recent Android version and be sure you can also
	switch, while the app is running, between day and night themes, with
	appropriate shifts in coloring, in both original and Prin themes.
	Keep an older version around as well.</p>
	<li><p>After #1 and #2 are working, so some research on styles vs
	themes, and be sure you understand both. Note for instance, that the
	style of the main button in TipTime is
	Widget.MaterialComponents.Button. Consider how this button &quot;knows&quot;
	to use the primary color as its background. Using this, arrange code
	so that the button instead uses the theme secondary color for its
	background, and so that switching themes automatically, <i>without
	altering the button configuration</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">,
	causes the button to show whichever secondary color is appropriate
	for the theme.</span></span></p>
	<li><p>If you accomplished #3 by altering one of the color
	properties of the button, that's fine. But now, if you didn't
	already, leave the color properties as they originally were, and
	instead alter *only* the style of the button, giving it a new style
	that is exactly like Widget.MaterialComponents.Button in all
	respects except that it uses the secondary color for background.
	(Note that this is how the Widget.MaterialComponents.Button style
	itself ties theme elements to specific aspects of the widget.)</p>
	<li><p>If you wanted to set a different theme for two different
	layouts in an application (e.g. in two different activities) is this
	allowed, and how?</p>
	<li><p>&quot;Mipmapping&quot; is a much larger concept outside of
	Android, beyond the specific application in the path. Look it up,
	and briefly describe how it's used in other areas. For instance, how
	might mipmapping be useful even if the object in question is not
	changing its physical size? Why is mipmapping useful, as opposed to
	just having one image and computationally scaling it? Can you do
	mipmaps with just a single image file? How does this work?</p>
	<li><p>Which of the two major ways Android represents icons is a
	form of SVG? Why? Which of the two is your Android device (or
	emulator) using? Why?</p>
	<li><p>After doing the path exercise to change the tiptime icon to a
	white bell on green background, redo it as a gold bell on a shaded
	blue background, and properly regenerate all assets needed. Do this
	by selected hand-modification of the XML assets for the
	white-on-green; it doesn't take much. Be sure this works both on
	older Android versions (pre-26) and newer ones.</p>
	<li><p>After doing the switch to Material for the EditText and
	Switch, do it also for the Button, replacing it with a material
	&quot;floating action button&quot; (pick the right type of floating
	action button based on the docs). Maintain the customized style, but
	be sure you derive from the right base style now that you've changed
	the button.</p>
	<li><p>When adding icons, use a dollar-sign icon for the Cost of
	Service label. Be sure the 3-line editText we added is also indented
	like the other components. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Mess around a bit with style and theme so that 
	</p>
</ol>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p>the dollar-sign icon is always Principia blue, night or day</p>
		<li><p>the service icon is <i>unchanged </i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">from
		the original XML, and yet it shows prin blue during daylight, and
		its default behavior during night. </span></span>
		</p>
		<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">The
		round-up arrow is whatever secondary color is specified by the
		theme, and thus changes appropriately night and day.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ol start="12">
	<li><p>When setting up the key handler for removing the entry
	keypad, answer the following:</p>
</ol>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p align="left">If you return &quot;true&quot; from the
		handler, regardless of keyCode, what is the effect on the UI? Why?</p>
		<li><p align="left">Look up the type of the parameter for
		setOnKeyListener. This is not a function, but we're passing a
		lambda. How does that work, and what three letter acronym describes
		what the parameter is, and why the lambda matches it?</p>
		<li><p align="left">Why do we have to use a lambda in
		setOnKeyListener? The handleKeyEvent function is a function --
		won't it suffice directly, e.g. setOnKeyListener(handleKeyEvent)?
		What if we added a third parameter to handleKeyEvent? What then?</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ol start="13">
	<li><p>Do the Practice Exercise from Polished User Experience to
	dress up your unit converter application</p>
	<li><p>Don't download the ZIP in the testing section. Instead, just
	use the starting code already available in your TipTime default
	project under androidTest. Add a number of other tests to the one
	example given:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>Test the behavior with empty cost, followed by good cost,
		followed again by empty cost. (Tip result should clear on empty
		cost)</p>
		<li><p>Test the behavior of the round-up switch, including
		automatic reset when a tip is computed (but not just because
		Calculate Tip is pressed)</p>
		<li><p>Test bad-number values in the cost, ensuring no tip is
		computed, and the bad value is cleared.</p>
		<li><p>Add at least another test of your own.</p>
