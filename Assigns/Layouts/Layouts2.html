<h3 class="western">Overview</h3>
<p>This and later exercises will draw on the introductory courses
supplied at 
</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses</p>
<p>and for the first homeworks, this course in particular:</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course</p>
<p>Each of these courses is somewhat &quot;code by the numbers&quot;
overview of Android dev topics. To use them effectively, note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The videos are mostly just cute rah-rah, so you can skip
	those.</p>
	<li><p>The codelab walkthroughs are where the serious content is.
	For these, actually write the code, don't just copy-paste it. As you
	write each line, be sure you understand what it does and why.</p>
	<li><p>Where feasible, first *guess* what the code should be and
	then read their suggested code.</p>
	<li><p>Explore &quot;around&quot; the code, trying different
	alternatives to see how they work. I'll help with this by assigning
	required homework explorations surrounding the code in the
	walkthroughs.</p>
	<li><p>Do the quiz at the end of each path, and please report as
	part of your homework submission how well you did on it.</p>
	<li><p>A canned example like these codelabs, however well design
	point of this question is to do, at least for one case, independent
	e(E.g. deeper exploration of one or more of the classes used, of
	Gradle, of other widgets, etc.).
