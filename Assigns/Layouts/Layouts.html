<h3 class="western">Overview</h3>
<p>This and later exercises will draw on the introductory courses
supplied at 
</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses</p>
<p>and for the first homeworks, this course in particular:</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course</p>
<p>Each of these courses is somewhat &quot;code by the numbers&quot;
overview of Android dev topics. To use them effectively, note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The videos are mostly just cute rah-rah, so you can skip
	those.</p>
	<li><p>The codelab walkthroughs are where the serious content is.
	For these, actually write the code, don't just copy-paste it.  And:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>First, read through a portion of the presentation, up to an
		entire path depending on how good your memory is.</p>
		<li><p>Then, *set aside the example code and presentation*, and
		write the code yourself, from memory as much as possible, checking
		the presentation only as absolutely necessary.</p>
		<li><p>As you write each line, be sure you understand what it does
		and why.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>A canned example like these codelabs is just a starting
	point.  
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Do deeper exploration of the classes used, via the API
		reference and other sources.  Find out how they're organized, what
		their inheritance relationships are, etc.  Bookmark useful points
		of the API reference.</p>
		<li><p>Based on what you learned, explore &quot;around&quot; the
		code, trying different alternatives to see how they work. 
		</p>
		<li><p>I'll help with this by assigning required homework
		explorations surrounding the code in the walkthroughs, but learn
		also to do this for yourself.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Do the quiz at the end of each path, and please report as
	part of your homework submission how well you did on it.</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">Unit 2: Layouts: <b>Create XML Layouts for
Android Pt 1</b></h3>
<p>Do this path, and answer the following questions as you do:</p>
<p>1. In what package does EditText reside? In what class is its id
property defined? 
</p>
<p>2. Add an EditText between calculate tip and tip amout, called
notes, having 3 lines. This will require reading docs on EditView,
and also reading up on the input method type.</p>
<p>3. Add a 1/8 in gap between the Rate the Service label and the
Cost of Service EditText. Explain what &quot;dp&quot; stands for, and
how you can be sure the gap will be 1/8 in regardless of the device
DPI value. This will entail research into ConstraintLayout,
Dimension, etc.</p>
<p>4. In what top-level package (e.g. android or androidx) does
EditText reside? What about ConstraintLayout? Dimension? Why are
these top-levels different? Are androidx classes necessary for coding
Android layouts? Why or why not? This requires alert reading
regarding these two major package families and the evolution of the
Android UI libraries.</p>
<p>5. In the final stage when you set up a binding, try mislabelling
an element, e.g. binding.CotOfService instead of
binding.CostOfService. Rebuild. What is the result?</p>
<p>6. Rewrite the logic for calculateTip without the binding object,
instead using findViewById. Also, automatically turn off the round-up
switch after every time a tip is calculated, so it must be reset each
time it's used.</p>
<p>7. Do the small coding exercise offered as step 11 of the path.
Submit a layout XML file for this, and a snapshot of your emulator
running the layout. Do about half of this work by hand-modification
of the XML, and half via the Design window and its Attributes panel.
Note the interplay between Design and Code. (A Split view will help
with this.).</p>
<p>8. Investigate android.util.Log, and use it to write a logging
message announcing the value of cost in calculateTip, when that value
is nonnull. (This is how you do a debugging &quot;println&quot; in
Android code.)</p>
<p>9. Do the quiz at the end of the path, and please report as part
of your homework submission how well you did on it.</p>
<p>10. Describe one independent exploration, similar to the ones I've
asked you to do above, that you performed, and what you learned. (See
bullets above)</p>
<h3 class="western">Submission</h3>
<p>Submit three files:</p>
<p>1. Questions.pdf/docx/html with answers to the noncoding
questions.</p>
<p>2. MainActivity.kt and activity_main.xml, for your answers for 6
and 3, after demoing to me</p>
<p>3. UnitConverter.kt and unit_converter.xml, for your answers for
#7, after demoing for me</p>
