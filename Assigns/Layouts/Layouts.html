<h3 class="western">Overview</h3>
<p>This and later exercises will draw on the introductory courses
supplied at 
</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses</p>
<p>and for the first homeworks, this course in particular:</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course</p>
<p>Each of these courses is somewhat &quot;code by the numbers&quot;
overview of Android dev topics.  To use them effectively, note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The videos are mostly just cute rah-rah, so you can skip
	those.</p>
	<li><p>The codelab walkthroughs are where the serious content is.
	For these, actually write the code, don't just copy-paste it. As you
	write each line, be sure you understand what it does and why.</p>
	<li><p>Where feasible, first *guess* what the code should be and
	then read their suggested code.</p>
	<li><p>Explore &quot;around&quot; the code, trying different
	alternatives to see how they work. I'll help with this by assigning
	required homework explorations surrounding the code in the
	walkthroughs.</p>
	<li><p>Do the quiz at the end of each path, and please report as
	part of your homework submission how well you did on it.</p>
</ul>
<p><br/>

<h3 class="western">Unit 2: Layouts</h3>
<p>Do this course in its entirety (through &quot;Display a scrollable
list&quot;), and answer the following questions as you do:</p>
<p>X. Do the small coding exercise offered as step 11 of the Create
XML Layouts path.  Submit a layout XML file for this, and a snapshot
of your emulator running the layout.</p>
