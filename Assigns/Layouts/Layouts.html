<h3 class="western">Overview</h3>
<p>This and later exercises will draw on the introductory courses
supplied at 
</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses</p>
<p>and for the first homeworks, this course in particular:</p>
<p>https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course</p>
<p>Each of these courses is somewhat &quot;code by the numbers&quot;
overview of Android dev topics. To use them effectively, note:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The videos are mostly just cute rah-rah, so you can skip
	those.</p>
	<li><p>The codelab walkthroughs are where the serious content is.
	For these, actually write the code, don't just copy-paste it. As you
	write each line, be sure you understand what it does and why.</p>
	<li><p>Where feasible, first *guess* what the code should be and
	then read their suggested code.</p>
	<li><p>Explore &quot;around&quot; the code, trying different
	alternatives to see how they work. I'll help with this by assigning
	required homework explorations surrounding the code in the
	walkthroughs.</p>
	<li><p>Do the quiz at the end of each path, and please report as
	part of your homework submission how well you did on it.</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">Unit 2: Layouts: <b>Create XML Layouts for
Android Pt 1</b></h3>
<p>Do this path, and answer the following questions as you do:</p>
<p>1. In what package does EditText reside?  In what class is its id
property defined?  
</p>
<p>2. Add an EditView between calculate tip and tip amout, called
notes, having 3 lines.  This will require reading docs on EditView,
and also reading up on the input method type.</p>
<p>3. Add a 1/8 in gap between the Rate the Service label and the
Cost of Service EditView.  Explain what &quot;dp&quot; stands for,
and how you can be sure the gap will be 1/8 in regardless of the
device DPI value.  This will entail research into ConstraintLayout,
Dimension, etc.</p>
<p>4. In what top-level package (e.g. android or androidx) does
EditText reside?  What about ConstraintLayout?  Dimension?  Why are
these top-levels different?  Are androidx classes necessary for
coding Android layouts?  Why or why not?  This requires alert reading
regarding these two major package families and the evolution of the
Android UI libraries.</p>
<p>5. Do the small coding exercise offered as step 11 of the path.
Submit a layout XML file for this, and a snapshot of your emulator
running the layout.  Do about half of this work by hand-modification
of the XML, and half via the Design window and its Attributes panel. 
Note the interplay between Design and Code.  (A Split view will help
with this.)</p>
