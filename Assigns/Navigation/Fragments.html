<h3 class="western">Unit 2: Fragments</h3>
<p>Much of this path centers on <i>fragments</i><span style="font-style: normal">
-- a means of changing what looks like Activities, without the heavy
overhead of starting and stopping full processes.</span></p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Consider the
	property declaration that appears in both fragments:  <font face="Liberation Mono, monospace">val
	binding get() = _binding!!</font></p>
</ol>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">What
		is the role of the variable _binding?  (A Kotlin language term)</font></p>
		<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Why
		do we need the !! operator?  What would we need to do to make the
		property compile if we removed the !!?  What are we counting on the
		user of the Fragment not to do?</font></p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">The third
	parameter of inflate in both Fragments is left false.  What is the
	purpose of this parameter, and why does leaving it false make sense
	given this is a Fragment?</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Why are
	onCreateView and onCreateOptionsMenu *passed* inflaters as
	parameters, when in the earlier Activity/Intent based version of the
	WordsApp there was a menuInflater and a layoutInflater just
	&quot;available&quot; in OnCreate and OnCreateOptionsMenu?   Why
	could the earlier version just use existing inflaters?  Where were
	they declared that made this possible?  Why is it necessary to pass
	inflaters to the Fragments?  What inflaters are being passed?</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Why does
	onCreateOptionsMenu no longer return a boolean as it did in the
	Activity/Intent version, and why is the passed-in menu now
	nonnullable?  What did a false-return from onCreateOptionsMenu
	signify in the earlier case?  How is that handled for Fragments, and
	why does this mean the Fragment onCreateOptionsMenu now returns Unit
	(right?) and takes a nonnullable Menu.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Why is the
	android:label value in the navigation graph?  Shouldn't that be part
	of the fragment layout itself?  When would this possibly-odd
	decision be useful?</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Why don't we
	do binding operations in onCreate instead of onCreateView?</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Why does the
	navigation graph attach arguments to the target, instead of the
	action?  The arguments are clearly attached to the action in the
	navigate call.</p>
	<li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">What
	is the &quot;letter =&quot; notation in th</span></span>e
	actionLetterListFragmentToWordListFragment c<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">all
	in LetterAdapter?  Is that an assignment statement embedded in the
	call?</span></span></p>
	<li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Why
	do the navigation-specialized tests need ApplicationProvider, while
	earlier tests e.g. for Quotes, even those that tested the UI, did
	not?  What do you think the TestNavHostController does with the
	context passed to it?   This question is really asking you to
	understand the structural difference between earlier UI tests and
	these navigation-specialized tests.</span></span></p>
	<li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">What
	type of thing does launchFragmentInContainer return?  Is the
	&quot;themeResId =&quot; in the call needed?  What would happen if
	we omitted it? Why?  </span></span>
	</p>
	<li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"> <span style="font-style: normal">How
	many deprecated functions are there in
	androidx.fragment.app.testing?  What does this suggest about the
	design history of this testing library?  How do you feel about the
	design of the fragment testing library in general?</span></span></p>
	<li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"> <span style="font-style: normal">Write
	a standard UI test for this application, like those for Quotes and
	Dogglers.  This one should start at the first page, drill down to
	the &quot;C&quot; words, and verify that C words are now showing.</span></span></p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">As with
	prior exercises, describe one deeper exploration you did springing
	off of the concepts in this path, which docs you found useful, etc.</p>
